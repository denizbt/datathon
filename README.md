Deniz, Katie, and Laura's 2023 Datathon Project :)

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset
The images in the dataset were originally organized into Non-Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented. There are much fewer Moderate Demented images in the data set. The images can be found in the repo under the folder datasets.
